Requirements for week 7: 
[x] Get real recipes from Spoonacular API 
[/] Show recipe cards based on API data 
- They are showing but need to be styled
[x] Customize filtering/sorting to API 
[x] Show an error message if the API quota is exhausted

Stretchgoals: 
[x] Make your filters and sorting options work together so that the user, for example, can filter on vegetarian & popular recipes or Italian vegan recipes
[x] Show a loading state while fetching data
[x] Allow users to search for specific recipe names or ingredients
[] Implement local storage caching to reduce API requests
[] Allow users to save/like recipes and store them in local storage. 
- This includes adding a heart button to the recipe card and 
- adding a "View favourites" button that only shows favourite recipes.
[] Implement pagination for large results or infinite scrolling (e.g. fetching more recipes when the user has reached the bottom)
