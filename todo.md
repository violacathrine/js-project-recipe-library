My todo-list for this project:

[] Add a function to show all recipes when the page loads.
[] Implement proper filtering so that recipes are actually updated
[] Add sorting function to arrange recipes by time
[] Add a button that selects a random recipe
[] Make sure a message is displayed if no recipes match the filter
